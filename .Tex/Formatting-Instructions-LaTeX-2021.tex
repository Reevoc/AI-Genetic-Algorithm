\begin{abstract}

\noindent Precise mRNA splicing is required for proper protein translation. Point mutations in sequences can result in incorrect recognition and in the creation of an abnormal transcript of the altered gene. Typically, these mutations induce mistakes during the splicing process, which might affect the open reading frame. Hence, the Genetic algorithm nearly perfectly describes this type of problem: we have a set population of proteins and we want to understand where the mutations come from. As a result, the major purpose is to rebuild the likely step that led to the mutation from a mutated and provided population using the logic of a Genetic Algorithm.

\end{abstract}

\section{Project Purpose}
Some $DNA$ $mutations$ are quiet and have no impact, but others influence protein, which regulate whether the gene is active or not, produces more or less protein or changes protein synthesis entirely. A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence that is caused by either a mistake during DNA replication or chemical damage. Genes are regions of the genome that contain the instructions for the synthesis of protein molecules, which perform the majority of the vital functions in cells. Understanding the cause of a mutation of a certain section of DNA can lead to understanding what happened during the history of protein mutation.
By constructing a $big$ $pool$ $of$ $string$ $of$ $Genes$, this algorithm will be able to quickly identify what is likely the protein where the mutation came from.

\section{How it is done}
Genetic Algorithms are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that are a subset of $evolutionary$ $algorithms$. These are clever exploitations of random search given by historical data to lead the search into the solution space area of greater performance. 
In other words, they replicate "survival of the fittest" among individuals of successive generations in order to solve a problem. 
Each generation is made up of a population of individuals, with each individual representing a point in the search space and a potential solution. Every person is represented by a string of character/integer/float/bits. This string is similar to the Chromosome. 
\section{Creation of The Population}
For this part, it is really important to define a $optimal solution$ and a $population$ that correspond to a list of $chromosome$ of the same length of the optimal solution:
\[population = {'AGTT', 'AGTT', ...}\]
\[chromosome = {'AGTT'}\]
\[optimal = {'ACCC'}\]

\section{Fitness Function}
Firstly, it has been noticed that each new generation has more $superior$ $genes$ on average than the individual (solution) of prior generations. As a result, each successive generation has better $partial$ $answers$ than prior generations. This is translated in our instance because we are mutating in the right way to discover a perfect matching chromosome with the optimal solution. The underlying difficulty with this fitness score function is that there is no standard method to write it.
Looking online, many researchers claim that writing a fitness function is a really difficult task. However, there is one that works the majority of the time, and it is the one that uses the absolute value between each chromosome and the optimal solution.\\
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
         A & 65 \\
         G & 71\\
         T & 84 \\
         C & 67 \\
         U & 85
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{ASCII code for nucleotides}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
\[ absolute = |A - G| = |65 - 71| = 6 \]

\section{Evolution}
Once the fitness function is defined, the next step is to conduct two critical operations that allow the algorithm to develop without assistance. The first operation that was developed was the $crossover$, which consists in flipping a portion of two chromosomes by placing two cross sites. This process is carried out on the chromosomes with the highest $fitness$ $score$ using a $random$ $choice$ $probability$, such that the next population generated is closer to the solution.\\
\[{'\textbf{AGTTCT}'}, {'ACCCTG'}\]
\[crossover index = {1:3}\]
\[{'\textbf{A}CCC\textbf{CT}'},{'A\textbf{GTT}TG'}\] \\
The other operation is called $mutation$, and it was one of the most critical parameters to fix during the experiment since a high mutation rate resulted in the failure to discover a solution. The new population created, as a result, is just a random one of the previous population. Meanwhile, by using a low mutation rate, the algorithm results in a simple permutation because of/due to the crossover operation. As a consequence, the Algorithm stops and it is not able to reachÂ anyÂ solution.\\ 
\['AGTCCTC' ---> '\textbf{C}GTCCT\textbf{A}' \] \\

\section{Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the optimal protein
    \item Create the population
    \item Define fitness score function 
    \item Until does not find optimal protein:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select 2 chromosomes based on their random choices probability 
        \item Perform crossover operation and mutation operation
        \item place the 2 new chromosomes in the population
        \item calculates the fitness for the population 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Tools used in the project}
What is used during the experiment:
\begin{itemize}
\item vscode
\item \href{https://github.com/Reevoc/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE}{GitHub}
\item Python 
\item Jupiter Notebook
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}
It is possible to see how the experiment is carried out, by looking at the table on the following pages. An optimal protein is chosen to locate and test with a different kind of parameter. Two different types of graphics are displayed for each experiment. The first demonstrates the development of the learning trend and the approach to the answer epoch after epoch. The other graphic demonstrates the variation between the last population generated and the ideal protein that we gave at the beginning. In particular, the difference from the ideal one increases with the height of the histogram bar, the more is high the more is different and vice-versa.

\section{Future work}
In future work, it will be interesting to test this kind of algorithm in real databases with well-known proteins and mutated ones. And see if the populations generated are correlated in some way to the evolution of the protein. Hence, it could be meaningful to understand the cause of mutation and likely it happens over time.
